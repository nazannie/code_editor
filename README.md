## Design Pattern

For this project, we created a custom Pattern that maximally uses the advantages of the JS & we named it File-Folder or FF
It consists of 2 classes (File & Folder) and 1 functional file
File is used to call functions to open and close tabs
Folder is used to create, delete and select child nodes i.e. File & Folder
